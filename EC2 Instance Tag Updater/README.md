## Overview

The Lambda function performs the following tasks:

  Utilizes Pythonâ€™s logging module to capture and report events and errors.
- **AWS Account Identification:**  
  Retrieves the AWS account ID using the STS service.
- **ARN Construction:**  
  Constructs the ARN for an EC2 instance based on the instance ID provided in the event.
- **Tagging:**  
  Uses the AWS Resource Groups Tagging API to apply the tag `"Environment": "Prod"` to the target instance.
- **Compliance Reporting:**  
  Returns a JSON response indicating that the resource complies with the specified tagging rule.
